# UXGQ

This is a tiny `tailwind-css` ui library build for React. The Project is based upon the awesome guidance of [Chris Scott](https://frontend.blog/build-your-own-flexible-component-library-using-tsdx-typescript-tailwind-css-headless-ui/)

## Motivation

I build this, as i am fallen in love with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Doing freelance projects, means often a bunch of replication.

## Keep things simple.

I dont want to re-create every f*ck*ing component from scratch. That's the reason why we i [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/) to keep things easy and accessible.
